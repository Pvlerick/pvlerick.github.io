<p>My name is Philippe Vlérick. I’m a developer at heart, and right now I’m mostly fascinated by everything that revolves around C# and the .NET framework. I'm holding a master degree and a bachelor degree in computer sciences.</p>
<p>I currently live in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Belgium&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=50.503887,4.469936&amp;spn=10.62918,23.203125&amp;z=6&amp;om=0 ">Belgium</a> (I added a link, just in case you don't know this wonderful country). My mother tongue is French, but I write here in English as I need to improve my written English and as it has broader audience. So, I hope you'll excuse my poor spelling and grammar, at least the mistakes that the spell checker left.</p>
<p>This blog is mostly used to track my struggles with technologies in my work, along with the information needed to solve these issues, hopefully. I might refer to it later and, who knows, it might be of any use to other people. It is bound to go in all directions as I write whatever I'm working on.</p>
<h3>Professional Status</h3>
<p>I'm currently an IT Architect for the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> in the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/index_en.htm">Directorate General Justice</a>. Before that, I worked as a developer for a service company, <a href="http://www.avanade.com/">Avanade</a> for about a year and a half and before that I worked for 3 years and a half for <a href="http://www.unisys.com">Unisys</a>, another service company.</p>
<p>I have been working on various projects, using Open Text's eDocs (formerly know as Hummingbird DM), developing in Java, developing on .NET platform while working on a research project, <a href="http://www.r4egov.eu">R4eGov</a> then in Java again, then in C# again, etc…</p>

<p>I also have been working as a freelance web developer for individual or small companies since 2005. This use to be my way to ear some extra money while being a student. This extra activity is now on hold due to my full time job, I might get back to it one day, who knows!</p>
