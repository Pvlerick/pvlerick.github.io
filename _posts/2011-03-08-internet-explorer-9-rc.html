<p>The RC of Internet Explorer 9 is out at the following address: <a title="http://windows.microsoft.com/ie9" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/ie9">http://windows.microsoft.com/ie9</a></p>
<p>For the moment, I’m exclusively using Chrome for browsing. I started using it when it first came out to give it a try, and it was so amazingly fast that returning to any other browser was painful. However, with this new version of IE, things have changed. IE9 is <em>very</em> fast. Also, the search function works like in Chrome, which is obviously a plus.</p>
<p>So, what I will do is try to use IE9 exclusively for 30 days and see what comes out of it. If I enjoy it enough, I might switch to it as my main browser, who knows?</p>
<p>For now, the two things I want from Chrome is offline mails for gmail (which might come with Gears that I’m installing right now) and a spell checker.</p>
