<p>h1. About</p>
<p>My name is Philippe Vlérick, I was born on the 20th of march 1981. I'm holding a master degree and a bachelor degree in computer (yeas, both. I know it's greedy).</p>
<p>I currently live in "Belgium":http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Belgium&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=50.503887,4.469936&amp;spn=10.62918,23.203125&amp;z=6&amp;om=0 (I added a link for those of you who don't know where it is, so you won't have wasted your time coming on this page...). My mother tongue is French, but I will mostly write in English as I need to improve my written English and as it has broader audience. So, if you are good at spelling (better than Firefox dictionary), please correct me when I'm wrong.</p>
<p>h3. Professional Status</p>
<p>I'm currently a developer for a big service company, "(external)Unisys":http://www.unisys.com. I have been working there since the first of august 2006.</p>
<p>I have been working on various projects, using Open Text's eDocs (formerly know as Hummingbird DM), developing in Java and now learning .NET while working on a research project, "(external)R4eGov":http://www.r4egov.eu.</p>
<p>I also have been working as a freelance web developer for individual or small companies since 2005. This use to be my way to ear some extra money while being a student. This extra activity is now on hold due to my full time job, but feel free to "contact":contact me if you have opportunities that you think I might be interested in.</p>
<p>h3. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>In my spare time, I like surfing the web (reading blogs and news sites), hacking around with HTML/CSS/Javascript, read and play on my Wii.</p>
<p>h3. Technology Used on this Website</p>
<p>This site runs on "(external)Textpattern":http://www.textpattern.org, with some useful extensions like zem_contact. This blog respects standards and validates both on "(external)Strict XHTML":http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer and "(external)CSS":http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer.</p>
