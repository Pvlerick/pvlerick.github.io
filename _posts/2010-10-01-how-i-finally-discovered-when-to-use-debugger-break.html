<p>The existence of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debugger.aspx">System.Diagnostics.Debugger</a> class is not something new to me, but I never figured out an usage for it. I never used it, and my knowledge was limited to think that it was a bit useless to code a breakpoint while you could set it in visual studio.</p>
<p>However, this makes quite a lot of sense in some scenarios, like programs that execute too fast, or PowerShell cmdlet that you don’t have a chance to attach to.</p>
