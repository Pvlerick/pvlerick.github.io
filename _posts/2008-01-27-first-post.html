<p>Hello to you, and welcome on my website. I have been owning this domain for nearly two years now and never used it. Actually, I started this blog as a New Year resolution, and after reading on of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000983.html%3E">Jeff Atwood's article</a> (excellent, as usual). So here I am.</p>
<p>I intend to post regularly about technical subjects that I find interesting. I am still working on the site design, but I think it is sufficient now to start publishing. I will be improving the design as I go along.</p>
<h2>Presentation and Background</h2>
<p>My name is Philippe Vlérick and I am a software developer. I have been graduated twice in computer science:</p>
<ul>
<li>Master degree in 2006 at <a href="http://www.ucl.be">UCL</a>;</li>
<li>Bachelor degree in 2004 at <a href="http://www.ipl.be">IPL</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am currently working as a consultant for a large service provider company: <a href="http://www.unisys.com">Unisys</a>.</p>
<p>I live in Belgium near Brussels. In my spare time, I spend time learning webdesign technologies (CSS, Javascript...), reading books and playing Wii.</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>First, I would like like to thank <a href="http://www.textpattern.org">Textpattern</a> that is the heart of this blog. I would also like to thank <a href="http://www.randomjabber.com">Deron Sizemore</a> for his set of <a href="http://www.randomjabber.com/static/sizcons/">icons</a> that I'm using, as I've never been good at making up graphics.</p>
