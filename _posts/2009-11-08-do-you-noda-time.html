<p>A few days ago, Jon Skeet <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2009/11/05/what-s-in-a-name-again.aspx">announced</a> that he was starting an open source project with a unknown name (that found itself named Noda Time) that aimed to provide a .NET equivalent to <a href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/">Joda Time</a>.</p>
<p>As there were clearly some openings, I proposed to join, and there is now a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/noda-time">Google Group for the project</a>. Jon has great expectations for the project itself but also for the methodology. He wants that project to be model:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I want it to be a shining example of how to build, maintain and deploy an open source .NET library.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m really eager to see how this will go. I think this is a great opportunity for me to learn a lot of new stuff and meet people.</p>
<p>Next steps for me are to keep up with the ongoing discussions and learn more about Joda Time as I never used it.</p>
<p> I hope I can prove myself useful!</p>
