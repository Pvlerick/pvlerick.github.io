<p>Reading <a href="http://cc2e.com/">Code Complete</a>, I was very interested by the graphical showing how the smallest changes are the ones that are the more likely to contain errors.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/weinberg1983-thumb.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Weinberg1983" src="/assets/weinberg1983-thumb.png" width="500" height="270" /></a> </p>
<p>This graph shows that <strong>changes of 4 lines have a 75% chance of introducing new errors</strong>.</p>
<p>As outlined in that particular part of the book (Chapter 24.4 - &quot;Refactoring Safely&quot;), as programmers we tend to treat small changes casually. We all know that those <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8#t=23m23">one line changes can't possibly break, right?</a></p>
<p>How ironical?</p>
<p>So let us all be carefull with minor changes, or we'll get certified on the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000818.html">&quot;Works on My Machine&quot; Certification Program</a>.</p>
