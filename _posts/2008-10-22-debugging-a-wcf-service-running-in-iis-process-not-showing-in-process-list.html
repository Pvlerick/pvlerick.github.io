<p>Few days ago, I wanted to debug a WCF service hosted in IIS (on localhost). Sounds simple, just use Visual Studio &quot;Debug &gt; Attach to Process...&quot; command (Ctrl + Alt + P).</p>
<p>However, <strong>aspnet_wp.exe</strong> (running Windows XP) was not displayed in the list of running processes (while the &quot;Show processes from all users&quot; was checked).</p>
<p>So I started crawling the web to find why this process didn't show up in the list. And the answer was very simple: this process is not started if no request has been made yet. Simply heading to the <em>.svc</em> URI of the service started the process, which was then available in the list of processes.</p>
