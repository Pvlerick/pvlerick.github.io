<p>First day on Io, which I never heard about…</p>
<blockquote><p>Io is a dynamic prototype-based programming language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from JavaScript, I never heard any other prototype-based language. And even in JavaScript, I don’t know exactly what this implies, so my expectation of learning new things while studying Io is quite high, which is good!</p>
<p>By the way, Io is the name of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(mythology)">nymph in Greek mythology</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon)">one of Jupiter’s satellite</a>. Believe it or not, but I knew that before encountering the language, and still wonder if there is any relation whatsoever, but didn’t find anything about the language name’s origin…</p>
<p><a href="/assets/Io-thumb.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Io" border="0" alt="Io" src="/assets/Io_thumb.png" width="105" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>(to me it was the perfect excuse to put a picture of a sexy girl on my blog and get more traffic!)</p>
<p>Anyway, first task, get Io to run on my box, namely a Windows 7 x64 machine. After <a href="http://www.iolanguage.com/">downloading the sources</a> and trying to build them according to the readme.txt, lots of errors…</p>
<p>Finally, I found that the best solution is to <a href="http://www.iolanguage.com/downloads/">download the binaries</a> which work fine on my machine. That’ll do for now.</p>
<p>I also needed some reference to lookup to when in doubt, and that’s all available <a href="http://iolanguage.com/scm/io/docs/IoGuide.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, on day one, no real assignments, or at least nothing that can’t be found in 30 seconds on the official website, so I’m not going to replicate this here.</p>
