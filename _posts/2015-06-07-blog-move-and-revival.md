It's been a while since I left this blog unattended, it was time I did something about it.

I decided to do two changes:

- Host the blog in GitHub pages instead of my own hosting provider
- Follow the late trend of migrating to Jeckyll/Bootstrap

Let's see how it goes, and I hope to be blogging a bit more often.
