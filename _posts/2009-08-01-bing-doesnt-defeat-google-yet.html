<p>Two month ago, I set Bing as my default search engine in Chrome. I did this after reading one of <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BosomBuddiesHowToMakeGoogleChromeUseMicrosoftBingForSearch.aspx">Scott Hanselman’s blog post</a>. The idea was to give the <a href="http://www.bing.com/">new Microsoft search engine</a> a try, see if it could handle my daily needs.</p>
<p>During the first month, everything went right, I didn’t have to go back to Google once as far as I remember.</p>
<p>However, for the last few weeks, I had to go back to Google for some searches… I’m sure you know the feeling. You search for something on a search engine that is not Google, and when you look at the results you feel like something is hidden from you. Then you head to Google, try the same keywords, and get exactly what you were looking for.</p>
<p>I’m a bit disappointed. I really liked Bing’s overall look and feel, the changing background image, and the fact that it was a competitor to Google supremacy. I thought they finally put together a good search algorithm. In fact they are quite close, but not there yet.</p>
<p>I’ll give it another try in a few months, but for now I’m back to Google.</p>
