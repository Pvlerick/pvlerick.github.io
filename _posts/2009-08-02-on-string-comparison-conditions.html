<p>When I was doing String comparison, I always use to do it this way:</p>
<pre class="code"><span style="color: #2b91af">String </span>s = <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;Philippe&quot;</span>;

<span style="color: blue">if </span>(s.Equals(<span style="color: #a31515">&quot;Philippe&quot;</span>))
{
    <span style="color: green">//Not relevant
</span>}</pre>

<p>For me, it seems the natural way to write that condition. You can read it out loud as “if s is equal to Philippe”.</p>
<p>However, as the String could come as <em>null</em>, I always ended up with something like this:</p>
<pre class="code"><span style="color: blue">if </span>(s != <span style="color: blue">null </span>&amp;&amp; s.Equals(<span style="color: #a31515">&quot;Philippe&quot;</span>))
{
    <span style="color: green">//Not relevant
</span>}</pre>
<p><a href="http://11011.net/software/vspaste"></a>This way, the <em>s.Equals</em> wouldn't throw a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.nullreferenceexception.aspx"><em>NullReferenceException</em></a> in case of <em>s</em> being <em>null</em>. Again, reading it out loud would be: “if s is not null and s is equal to Philippe”.</p>
<p>And what about doing this:</p>
<pre class="code"><span style="color: blue">if </span>(<span style="color: #a31515">&quot;Philippe&quot;</span>.Equals(s))
{
    <span style="color: green">//Not relevant
</span>}</pre>
<p><a href="http://11011.net/software/vspaste"></a></p>
<p>It feels a lot less natural to me, but the benefits are worth it. Only one condition and no risk of <em>NullReferenceException.</em> If <em>s</em> is <em>null</em>, this will simply return <em>false</em>. It would read as “if Philippe is equal to s”, which doesn’t sound too good, but doesn’t hurt code’s readability.</p>
<p>Just a small trick I wanted to share. I figured it out while reading someone else’s code, which is always interesting.</p>
