<p>Quick tip, should get me out of blogging hibernation.</p>
<p>It’s a common issue to find an assembly’s strong name, but this can be done very easily with a simple PowerShell function:</p>
<pre lang="PowerShell">function Get-AssemblyStrongName($assemblyPath)
{
	[System.Reflection.AssemblyName]::GetAssemblyName($assemblyPath).FullName
}</pre>
<p>Simply give the assembly's full path and you'll get the strong name in return.</p>
<p>Personnaly, I have that in my <em>$profile</em> file and have an alias <em>gan</em> for it.</p>
