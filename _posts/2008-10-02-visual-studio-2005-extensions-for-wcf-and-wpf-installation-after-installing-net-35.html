<p>When .NET 3.0 was released, Microsoft provided a Visual Studio 2005 extension for WCF and WPF. This extension contains tools to ease development of these new technologies (for example, the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms732009.aspx">Configuration Editor Tool</a> that is quite useful to edit WCF configuration files).</p>
<p>If you are still using Visual Studio 2005, these tools are very useful (while not mandatory) to use .NET 3.0.</p>
<p>As I was reinstalling all my stuff on a new laptop, I started by installing .NET 3.5 SP1, then Visual Studio 2005. I only realized later that I forgot the WCF and WPF extensions for Visual Studio.</p>
<p>The first problem I encountered was that this extension is not available anymore on Microsoft's web site. This is not a mistake, and the why is that Microsoft wants to encourage users to move to Visual Studio 2008. Nice, thanks guys. You can read the details <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/acangialosi/archive/2008/06/27/vs-2005-extensions-for-net-framework-3-0-wpf-wcf-ctp-is-coming-off-the-ms-download-center.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is not too difficult to find this download. I personally found it on <a href="http://downloads.zdnet.co.uk/0,1000000375,39328336s,00.htm">ZDNet</a>.</p>
<p>Running the installation, I ran into some issue. The installer complains that a prerequisite is missing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Setup has detected that a prerequisite is missing. To use Visual Studio 2005 extensions for .NET Framework 3.0 (WCF &amp; WPF), November 2006 CTP you must have the .NET Framework 3.0 runtime installed. Please install the .NET Framework 3.0 runtime and restart setup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the installer is kind of dumb and checks that .NET 3.0 is installed, and only this precise version.</p>
<p>Once more, the solution is quite easy and can be found <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/Aneducatedguess/archive/2008/01/08/fixing-wcfwpf-vs-2005-extensions-installation-after-installing-vs-2008.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>The installer apparently checks for some registry key, so creating it is sufficient. The key is HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{15095BF3-A3D7-4DDF-B193-3A496881E003} under which a string value of &quot;DisplayName&quot;=&quot;Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0&quot; is needed. In my case, I had to create the last directory too.</p>
<p>After that, the installer process complained about some documentation issues but still ran correctly. The registry key can safely be deleted after the install process.</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">Update</font>: alternatively, you can run the following command in a DOS prompt:</p>
<blockquote><p>msiexec /i vsextwfx.msi WRC_INSTALLED_OVERRIDE=1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will display the same warning message about .NET 3.0, but you can still install after the warning.</p>
