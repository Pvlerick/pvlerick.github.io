<p>Some time ago, I was asked to build a InfoPath form out of an <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSD">Xsd</a></em> file. I didn't had any experience using InfoPath, but it turned out to be pretty easy.</p>
<p>Today, I was asked if I could modify the form in order to take in account some changes in the <em>Xsd</em>.</p>
<p>My first attempt was to have a look in the <em>Data Source</em> part of the <em>Design Task</em> pane of the designer. However, everything in there is grayed out, so there is no way to change the values there.</p>
<p>My second attempt was to naively try to open the .xsn file with a text editor to see what was inside it. The content is, as expected, unreadable.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled upon this InfoPath Help and How-to article: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/infopath/HP100646591033.aspx">Extract or combine the form files for a form template</a>. This was what I was looking for, as it was showing how to &quot;disassemble&quot; the form into pieces, modify some of the content then build the form back. This is done by right clicking on the &quot;manifest.xsf&quot; file in windows explorer then choosing the &quot;Design&quot; option.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="/2008/12/infopathdesign.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="134" alt="InfoPathDesign" src="assets/infopathdesign-thumb.png" width="280" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p align="left">However, there is a catch. Simply replacing the old schema by the new one effectively changed in the <em>Data Source</em> part, but it was not automatically reflected in the form. InfoPath does not have a dynamic link to the Xsd file...</p>
<p align="left">To reflect the new changes from the Xsd, you'll have to delete the part that were changed in the form, and add them again on the form.</p>
