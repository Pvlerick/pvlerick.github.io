<p>In a "previous post":/2008/02/a-wsdl-file-for-yahoo-rest-api, I made an adapter in order to offer a WSDL endpoint to Yahoo! REST Api.</p>
<p>In this post, I will transform my solution in order to use "Windows Communication Foundation":http://netfx3.com/content/WCFHome.aspx to expose the endpoint (as WSDL again, but as you may know, it is easy to change the way endpoint are exposed with WCF.</p>
<p>h3. Windows Communication Foundation</p>
<p>WCF is based on "ABC":<br />
* _Address_ : where the message can be sent<br />
* _Binding_ : how to send the message (Tcp, Http, Named Pipes, MSMQ...)<br />
* _Contract_ : what is exposed to the outside world</p>
