<p>A recently bought the book titles “<a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a>”. The book has excellent reviews, and I have to say that in the list of languages it covers, I only have vague notions for some of them (Prolog, Clojure, Haskell), but absolutely no experience with any of them.</p>
<p>So, what I’m going to do is write my answers to the exercises on this blog, day by day (the book is divided by “days”) to keep track of my progress and findings. I started out by writing all of this in a text file for private use, but I figured that, after all, why not make it public?</p>
<p>This will probably look boring if you know any of these languages, but mind you that I have no experience whatsoever with nearly all of them.</p>
<p>So, let’s start with the very trendy Ruby!</p>
