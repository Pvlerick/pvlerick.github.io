<p>It’s funny because I never learned Ruby, I never wanted to because dynamic languages don’t move me much, but so far it’s been quite fun.</p>
<p>First, a link to <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/</a> that is the main reference to every question on that language.</p>
<p>I’m not going to run through all the exercises, but I will put solutions of those I found interesting to solve.</p>
<p>Print “This is sentence number 1” where the number 1 changes from 1 to 10:</p>
<pre lang="Ruby">(1..10).each { |i| puts "This is sentence number #{i}" }</pre>
<p>Bonus problem: write a program that picks a random number (I will do between 1 and 1024, how geeky!). Let the player guess a number, telling the player whether the guess is too low or too high:</p>
<pre lang="Ruby">max = 1024

guess = -1
number = rand(max) + 1

puts "Guess a number from 1 to #{max}"

until guess == number
  guess = gets.to_i
  puts "Number is greater than #{guess}" if number > guess
  puts "Number is lesser than #{guess}" if number < guess
end

puts "Well done!"</pre>
