My name is Philippe Vlérick. I’m a developer passionated about C# and everything that revolves arount the .NET framework/platform.

I live in [Belgium](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Belgium&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=50.503887,4.469936&amp;spn=10.62918,23.203125&amp;z=6&amp;om=0). My mother tongue is French, but I mainly write in English as it has broader audience and because ["If you don't know English, you're not a programmer."](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DoYouHaveToKnowEnglishToBeAProgrammer.aspx)

This blog is mostly used to track my struggles with technologies at work, and sometimes the solution to that struggle. I might refer to it later and, who knows, it might be of any use to other people. It is bound to go in all directions as I write whatever I'm working on.

### Professional Status

I currently work as a developer for [Ingenico Payment Services](http://payment-services.ingenico.com/int/en).

In the past, I worked an IT Architect for the [European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm) in the [Directorate General Justice](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/index_en.htm). Before that, I worked as a developer for a service company, [Avanade](http://www.avanade.com) for about a year and a half and before that I worked for 3 years and a half for [Unisys](http://www.unisys.com), another service company.

I have been working on various projects, my main area of expertise being C# and the .NET platform, but I also worked with Java and other various technologies.
